## End to End ML Project - Student Performance Prediction

In this project, the machine learning model aimed at forecasting student performance based on various academic and socio-economic factors. Leveraging a robust dataset, I performed extensive data cleaning and feature engineering to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the input variables. The model was built using Python, incorporating advanced algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Through iterative tuning and validation, the model achieved a high level of predictive accuracy, enabling educators to identify at-risk students and tailor interventions effectively. The project's comprehensive documentation, along with the complete codebase and performance metrics, is available in this repository, demonstrating my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and educational data mining.
